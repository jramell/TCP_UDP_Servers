# TCP/UDP Client and Servers in Java

"ASClient" contains the implementation in Java of a simple Android client that sends location and velocity information to certain servers using a network protocol chosen by the user. 

"ASServer" contains the implementation in Java of TCP and UDP servers that receive said information sent by the client through the network.

## How to run

### Servers

From a PC:

1. Verify your WiFi connection

2. Open the server

3. Press "Start"


### Client

From an Android phone:

1. Install the application

2. Connect to the same WiFi as the PC (application hasn't been tested on other conditions)

3. Make sure your GPS is on

4. Select the network protocol you would like your location to be sent

## Demonstration

As part of the project, I recorded a video in spanish that shows the servers working together with the Android client. The link is below:
